spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # Valid options are: [DoNotTerminate, Delete, WipeOut] (`Halt` is deprecated since KB 0.9)
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterDefinition to use when creating a Cluster.
  # Note: DO NOT UPDATE THIS FIELD
  # The value must be `kafaka` to create a Kafka Cluster
  clusterDef: kafka
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterTopology to be used when creating the
  # Cluster.
  # - combined: combined Kafka controller (KRaft) and broker in one Component
  # - combined_monitor: combined mode with monitor component
  # - separated: separated KRaft and Broker Components.
  # - separated_monitor: separated mode with monitor component
  # Valid options are: [combined,combined_monitor,separated,separated_monitor]
  topology: separated_monitor
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the
  # individual Components that make up a Cluster.
  # This field allows for detailed configuration of each Component within the Cluster
