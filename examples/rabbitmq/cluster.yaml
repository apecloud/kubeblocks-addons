spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster. This field allows for detailed configuration of each component within the Cluster.
  # Note: `shardingSpecs` and `componentSpecs` cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a cluster.
  # ClusterComponentSpec defines the specifications for a Component in a Cluster.
  componentSpecs:

      # The serviceVersion is used to determine the version of the Cluster. If the serviceVersion is not specified, the default value is the ServiceVersion defined in ComponentDefinition.
      # ServiceVersion specifies the version of the Service expected to be
      # provisioned by this Component.
      # Valid options are: [3.10.25,3.11.28,3.12.14,3.13.2,3.13.7,3.8.14,3.9.29]

      # Specifies the name of the ServiceAccount required by the running Component.
      # RabbitMQ needs `peer-discovery` role to create events and get endpoiints
      # This is essential for discovering other RabbitMQ nodes and forming a cluster.
      serviceAccountName: kb-rabbitmq-cluster
      # Recommended to set `replicas` to [3,5,7]
      # All data/state is replicated across all replicas.
