  # Specifies the name of the ClusterDefinition to use when creating a Cluster.
  clusterDefinitionRef: vllm
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # Valid options are: [DoNotTerminate, Delete, WipeOut] (`Halt` is deprecated since KB 0.9)
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster. This field allows for detailed configuration of each component within the Cluster.
  # Note: `shardingSpecs` and `componentSpecs` cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a cluster.
  # ClusterComponentSpec defines the specifications for a Component in a Cluster.
