# Weaviate

Weaviate is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.

In Weaviate, metadata replication and data replication are separate. For the metadata, Weaviate uses the **Raft consensus** algorithm. For data replication, Weaviate uses a **leaderless** design with eventual consistency[^1].

|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| No                     | Yes                   | Yes              | Yes       | Yes        | Yes       | Yes    | N/A      |

### Versions

| Versions |
|----------|
| 1.19.6 |

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster >= v1.21
- `kubectl` installed, refer to [K8s Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- Helm, refer to [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- KubeBlocks installed and running, refer to [Install Kubeblocks](../docs/prerequisites.md)
- Weaviate Addon Enabled, refer to [Install Addons](../docs/install-addon.md)

## Examples

### [Create](cluster.yaml)

Create a weaviate cluster with three replicas:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/cluster.yaml
```

### [Vertical scaling](verticalscale.yaml)

Vertical scaling up or down specified components requests and limits cpu or memory resource in the cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/verticalscale.yaml
```

### [Expand volume](volumeexpand.yaml)

Volume expansion is the ability to increase the size of a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) after it's created. It is introduced in Kubernetes v1.11 and goes GA in Kubernetes v1.24. It allows Kubernetes users to simply edit their PersistentVolumeClaim objects  without requiring any downtime at all if possible.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the storage class you use supports volume expansion.

Check the storage class with following command:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

If the `ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION` column is `true`, the storage class supports volume expansion.

To increase size of volume storage with the specified components in the cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/postgresql/volumeexpand.yaml
```

### [Restart](restart.yaml)

Restart the specified components in the cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/restart.yaml
```

### [Stop](stop.yaml)

Stop the cluster and release all the pods of the cluster, but the storage will be reserved

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/stop.yaml
```

### [Start](start.yaml)

Start the stopped cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/start.yaml
```

### [Configure](configure.yaml)

Configure parameters with the specified components in the cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/configure.yaml
```

It sets `QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT` to 150, and all pods will be restarted to apply the new configuration.

### Delete

If you want to delete the cluster and all its resource, you can modify the termination policy and then delete the cluster

```bash
kubectl patch cluster weaviate-cluster -p '{"spec":{"terminationPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"

kubectl delete cluster weaviate-cluster
```
