  # Specifies the clickhouse cluster topology defined in ClusterDefinition.Spec.topologies, support standalone, cluster
  # - `standalone`: single clickhouse instance
  # - `cluster`: clickhouse with ClickHouse Keeper as coordinator
  topology: standalone
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
