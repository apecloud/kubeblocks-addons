# Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to build real-time pipelines and can be used as a message broker or as a replacement for a log aggregation solution for big data applications.

- A broker is a Kafka server that stores data and handles requests from producers and consumers. Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers, each identified by a unique ID. Brokers work together to distribute and replicate data across the cluster.
- KRaft was introduced in Kafka 3.3.1 in October 2022 as an alternative to Zookeeper. A subset of brokers are designated as controllers, and these controllers provide the consensus services that used to be provided by Zookeeper.

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/cluster-separated.yaml
```

### Horizontal scaling

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As per the Kafka documentation, the number of KRaft replicas should be odd to avoid split-brain scenarios.
> Make sure the number of KRaft replicas, i.e. Controller replicas,  is always odd after Horizontal Scaling, either in Separated or Combined mode.

#### Scale-out

Horizontal scaling out `kafka-combine` component in cluster `kafka-combined-cluster` by adding ONE more replica:

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/scale-out.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kafka-combined-scale-out
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: kafka-combined-cluster
  type: HorizontalScaling
  # Lists HorizontalScaling objects, each specifying scaling requirements for a Component, including desired total replica counts, configurations for new instances, modifications for existing instances, and instance downscaling options
  horizontalScaling:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: kafka-combine
    # Specifies the replica changes for scaling in components
    scaleOut:
      # Specifies the replica changes for the component.
      # add one more replica to current component
      replicaChanges: 1

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/scale-out.yaml
```

After applying the operation, you will see a new pod created. You can check the progress of the scaling operation with following command:

```bash
kubectl describe ops kafka-combined-scale-out
```

#### Scale-in

Horizontal scaling in  `kafka-combine` component in cluster `kafka-combined-cluster` by deleting ONE replica:

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/scale-in.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kafka-combined-scale-in
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: kafka-combined-cluster
  type: HorizontalScaling
  # Lists HorizontalScaling objects, each specifying scaling requirements for a Component, including desired total replica counts, configurations for new instances, modifications for existing instances, and instance downscaling options
  horizontalScaling:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: kafka-combine
    # Specifies the replica changes for scaling in components
    scaleIn:
      # Specifies the replica changes for the component.
      # add one more replica to current component
      replicaChanges: 1

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/scale-in.yaml
```

#### Scale-in/out using Cluster API

Alternatively, you can update the `replicas` field in the `spec.componentSpecs.replicas` section to your desired non-zero number.

```yaml
# snippet of cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: kafka-combine
      replicas: 1 # Set the number of replicas to your desired number
```

### Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling up or down specified components requests and limits cpu or memory resource in the cluster:

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/verticalscale.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kafka-combined-vscale
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: kafka-combined-cluster
  type: VerticalScaling
  # Lists VerticalScaling objects, each specifying a component and its desired compute resources for vertical scaling.
  verticalScaling:
  - componentName: kafka-combine
    # VerticalScaling refers to the process of adjusting the compute resources (e.g., CPU, memory) allocated to a Component. It defines the parameters required for the operation.
    requests:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: 1Gi
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/verticalscale.yaml
```

#### Scale-up/down using Cluster API

Alternatively, you may update `spec.componentSpecs.resources` field to the desired resources for vertical scale.

```yaml
# snippet of cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: kafka-combine
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "1"       # Update the resources to your need.
          memory: "2Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
        limits:
          cpu: "2"       # Update the resources to your need.
          memory: "4Gi"  # Update the resources to your need.
```

### Expand volume

Volume expansion is the ability to increase the size of a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) after it's created. It is introduced in Kubernetes v1.11 and goes GA in Kubernetes v1.24. It allows Kubernetes users to simply edit their PersistentVolumeClaim objects  without requiring any downtime at all if possible.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the storage class you use supports volume expansion.

Check the storage class with following command:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

If the `ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION` column is `true`, the storage class supports volume expansion.

To increase size of volume storage with the specified components in the cluster:

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/volumeexpand.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kafka-combined-volumeexpansion
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: kafka-combined-cluster
  type: VolumeExpansion
  # Lists VolumeExpansion objects, each specifying a component and its corresponding volumeClaimTemplates that requires storage expansion.
  volumeExpansion:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: kafka-combine
    # volumeClaimTemplates specifies the storage size and volumeClaimTemplate name.
    volumeClaimTemplates:
    - name: data
      storage: 30Gi

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/volumeexpand.yaml
```

After the operation, you will see the volume size of the specified component is increased to `30Gi` in this case. Once you've done the change, check the `status.conditions` field of the PVC to see if the resize has completed.

```bash
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kafka-combined-cluster -n default
```

#### Volume expansion using Cluster API

Alternatively, you may update the `spec.componentSpecs.volumeClaimTemplates.spec.resources.requests.storage` field to the desired size.

```yaml
# snippet of cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: kafka-combine
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            storageClassName: "<you-preferred-sc>"
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 30Gi  # specify new size, and make sure it is larger than the current size
        - name: metadata
          spec:
            storageClassName: "<you-preferred-sc>"
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 10Gi  # specify new size, and make sure it is larger than the current size
```

### Restart

Restart the specified components in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/restart.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kafka-combine-restart
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: kafka-combined-cluster
  type: Restart
  # Lists Components to be restarted. ComponentOps specifies the Component to be operated on.
  restart:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: kafka-combine

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/restart.yaml
```

### Stop

Stop the cluster and release all the pods of the cluster, but the storage will be reserved

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/stop.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name:  kafka-combine-stop
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName:  kafka-combined-cluster
  type: Stop

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/stop.yaml
```

#### Stop using Cluster API

Alternatively, you may stop the cluster by setting the `spec.componentSpecs.stop` field to `true`.

```yaml
# snippet of cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: kafka-combine
      stop: true  # set stop `true` to stop the component
      replicas: 1
```

### Start

Start the stopped cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/start.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: kafka-combined-start
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: kafka-combined-cluster
  type: Start

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/start.yaml
```

#### Start using Cluster API

Alternatively, you may start the cluster by setting the `spec.componentSpecs.stop` field to `false`.

```yaml
# snippet of cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: kafka-combine
      stop: false  # set to `false` (or remove this field) to start the component
      replicas: 1
```

### Reconfigure

Configure parameters with the specified components in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/kafka/configure.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name:  kafka-combined-reconfiguring
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: kafka-combined-cluster
  # Instructs the system to bypass pre-checks (including cluster state checks and customized pre-conditions hooks) and immediately execute the opsRequest, except for the opsRequest of 'Start' type, which will still undergo pre-checks even if `force` is true.  Note: Once set, the `force` field is immutable and cannot be updated.
  force: false
  # Specifies a component and its configuration updates. This field is deprecated and replaced by `reconfigures`.
  reconfigures:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: kafka-combine
   # Contains a list of ConfigurationItem objects, specifying the Component's configuration template name, upgrade policy, and parameter key-value pairs to be updated.
    configurations:
      # Sets the parameters to be updated. It should contain at least one item.
      # The keys are merged and retained during patch operations.
    - keys:
        # Represents the unique identifier for the ConfigMap.
      - key: server.properties
        # Defines a list of key-value pairs for a single configuration file.
        # These parameters are used to update the specified configuration settings.
        parameters:
          # Represents the name of the parameter that is to be updated.
        - key: log.flush.interval.ms
          # Represents the parameter values that are to be updated.
          # If set to nil, the parameter defined by the Key field will be removed from the configuration file.
          value: "2000"
      # Specifies the name of the configuration template.
      name: kafka-configuration-tpl
  # Specifies the maximum number of seconds the OpsRequest will wait for its start conditions to be met before aborting. If set to 0 (default), the start conditions must be met immediately for the OpsRequest to proceed.
  preConditionDeadlineSeconds: 0
  type: Reconfiguring

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kafka/configure.yaml
```

This example update `log.flush.interval.ms` parameter of the `kafka-combine` component in the cluster `kafka-combined-cluster` to `1000`.
This parameter is the maximum time in ms that a message in any topic is kept in memory before flushed to disk. If not set, the value in log.flush.scheduler.interval.ms is used.

To verify the configuration change, you may log into the pod and check the configuration file.

```bash
cat  /opt/bitnami/kafka/config/kraft/server.properties | grep 'log.flush.interval.ms'
```

### Delete

If you want to delete the cluster and all its resource, you can modify the termination policy and then delete the cluster

```bash
kubectl patch cluster kafka-cluster -p '{"spec":{"terminationPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"

kubectl delete cluster kafka-cluster
```

### FAQ

#### How to Access Kafka Cluster

##### With Direct Pod Access

To connect to the Kafka cluster, you can use the following command to get the service for connection:

```bash
kubectl get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kafka-combined-cluster -n default
```

And the excepted output is like below:

```text
NAME                                                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kafka-combined-cluster-kafka-combine-advertised-listener-0   ClusterIP   10.96.221.254   <none>        9092/TCP   28m
```

You can connect to the Kafka cluster using the `CLUSTER-IP` and `PORT`.

##### With NodePort Service

Currently only `nodeport` and `clusterIp` network modes are supported for Kafka
To access the Kafka cluster using the `nodeport` service, you can create Kafka cluster with the following configuration,  refer to [Kafka Network Modes Example](./cluster-combined-nodeport.yaml) for more details.

```yaml
# snippet of cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: kafka-combine
      stop: false  # set to `false` (or remove this field) to start the component
      services:
        - name: advertised-listener
          serviceType: NodePort
          podService: true
      replicas: 1
      env:
        - name: KB_KAFKA_BROKER_HEAP
          value: "-XshowSettings:vm -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=100 -Ddepth=64"
        - name: KB_KAFKA_CONTROLLER_HEAP
          value: "-XshowSettings:vm -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=100 -Ddepth=64"
        - name: KB_BROKER_DIRECT_POD_ACCESS # set KB_BROKER_DIRECT_POD_ACCESS to FALSE to disable direct pod access
          value: "false"
```
