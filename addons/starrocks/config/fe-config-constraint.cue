	// Whether to synchronously execute the apply task at the publish phase of a load transaction. This parameter is applicable only to Primary Key tables. Valid values:
	// - `TRUE` (default): The apply task is synchronously executed at the publish phase of a load transaction. It means that the load transaction is reported as successful only after the apply task is completed, and the loaded data can truly be queried. When a task loads a large volume of data at a time or loads data frequently, setting this parameter to `true` can improve query performance and stability, but may increase load latency.
	// - `FALSE`: The apply task is asynchronously executed at the publish phase of a load transaction. It means that the load transaction is reported as successful after the apply task is submitted, but the loaded data cannot be immediately queried. In this case, concurrent queries need to wait for the apply task to complete or time out before they can continue. When a task loads a large volume of data at a time or loads data frequently, setting this parameter to `false` may affect query performance and stability.
	enable_sync_publish: bool | *true

	// Whether the FE strictly checks the storage medium of BEs when users create tables. If this parameter is set to `TRUE`, the FE checks the storage medium of BEs when users create tables and returns an error if the storage medium of the BE is different from the `storage_medium` parameter specified in the CREATE TABLE statement. For example, the storage medium specified in the CREATE TABLE statement is SSD but the actual storage medium of BEs is HDD. As a result, the table creation fails. If this parameter is `FALSE`, the FE does not check the storage medium of BEs when users create a table.
	enable_strict_storage_medium_check: bool | *false

	// Whether to automatically set the number of buckets.
	// - If this parameter is set to `TRUE`, you don't need to specify the number of buckets when you create a table or add a partition. StarRocks automatically determines the number of buckets.
	// - If this parameter is set to `FALSE`, you need to manually specify the number of buckets when you create a table or add a partition. If you do not specify the bucket count when adding a new partition to a table, the new partition inherits the bucket count set at the creation of the table. However, you can also manually specify the number of buckets for the new partition. Starting from version 2.5.7, StarRocks supports setting this parameter.

	alter_table_timeout_second: int | *86400

	// > **NOTE**
	// > - StarRocks shared-data clusters do not support this parameter.
	// > - If you need to configure the fast schema evolution for a specific table, such as disabling fast schema evolution for a specific table, you can set the table property [`fast_schema_evolution`](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-definition/CREATE_TABLE.md#set-fast-schema-evolution) at table creation.
	enable_fast_schema_evolution: bool | *false

	// Whether to replace a lost or corrupted tablet replica with an empty one. If a tablet replica is lost or corrupted, data queries on this tablet or other healthy tablets may fail. Replacing the lost or corrupted tablet replica with an empty tablet ensures that the query can still be executed. However, the result may be incorrect because data is lost. The default value is `FALSE`, which means lost or corrupted tablet replicas are not replaced with empty ones, and the query fails.

	// The Compaction Score threshold that triggers Compaction operations. When the Compaction Score of a partition is greater than or equal to this value, the system performs Compaction on that partition. - **Introduced in**: v3.1.0  The Compaction Score indicates whether a partition needs Compaction and is scored based on the number of files in the partition. Excessive number of files can impact query performance, so the system periodically performs Compaction to merge small files and reduce the file count. You can check the Compaction Score for a partition based on the `MaxCS` column in the result returned by running [SHOW PARTITIONS](../sql-reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/SHOW_PARTITIONS.md).

For example, if a partition has 10 tablets, performing one Compaction on that partition creates 10 Compaction tasks. If the number of concurrently executing Compaction tasks exceeds this threshold, the system will not create new Compaction tasks. Setting this item to `0` disables Compaction, and setting it to `-1` allows the system to automatically calculate this value based on an adaptive strategy.
