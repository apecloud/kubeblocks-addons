# This is magic for shellspec ut framework. "test" is a `test [expression]` well known as a shell command.
# Normally test without [expression] returns false. It means that __() { :; }
# function is defined if this script runs directly.
#
# shellspec overrides the test command and returns true *once*. It means that
# __() function defined internally by shellspec is called.
#
# In other words. If not in test mode, __ is just a comment. If test mode, __
# is a interception point.
#
# you should set ut_mode="true" when you want to run the script in shellspec file.
