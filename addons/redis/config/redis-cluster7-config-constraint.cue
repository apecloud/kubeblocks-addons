     // MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory

     // volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU, only keys with an expire set.
     // allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
     // volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU, only keys with an expire set.
     // allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
     // volatile-random -> Remove a random key having an expire set.
     // allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
     // volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
     // noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
     // LRU means Least Recently Used
     // LFU means Least Frequently Used
     // Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
     // randomized algorithms.
     // Note: with any of the above policies, when there are no suitable keys for
     // eviction, Redis will return an error on write operations that require
     // more memory. These are usually commands that create new keys, add data or
     // modify existing keys. A few examples are: SET, INCR, HSET, LPUSH, SUNIONSTORE,
