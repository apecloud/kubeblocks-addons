# Orioledb

OrioleDB is a new storage engine for PostgreSQL, bringing a modern approach to database capacity, capabilities and performance to the world's most-loved database platform.

## Prerequisites

This example assumes that you have a Kubernetes cluster installed and running, and that you have installed the kubectl command line tool and helm somewhere in your path. Please see the [getting started](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)  and [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for installation instructions for your platform.

Also, this example requires kubeblocks installed and running. Here is the steps to install kubeblocks, please replace "`$kb_version`" with the version you want to use.
```bash
# Add Helm repo 
helm repo add kubeblocks https://apecloud.github.io/helm-charts
# If github is not accessible or very slow for you, please use following repo instead
helm repo add kubeblocks https://jihulab.com/api/v4/projects/85949/packages/helm/stable

# Update helm repo
helm repo update

# Get the versions of KubeBlocks and select the one you want to use
helm search repo kubeblocks/kubeblocks --versions
# If you want to obtain the development versions of KubeBlocks, Please add the '--devel' parameter as the following command
helm search repo kubeblocks/kubeblocks --versions --devel

# Create dependent CRDs
kubectl create -f https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/releases/download/v$kb_version/kubeblocks_crds.yaml
# If github is not accessible or very slow for you, please use following command instead
kubectl create -f https://jihulab.com/api/v4/projects/98723/packages/generic/kubeblocks/v$kb_version/kubeblocks_crds.yaml

# Install KubeBlocks
helm install kubeblocks kubeblocks/kubeblocks --namespace kb-system --create-namespace --version="$kb_version"
```
Enable orioledb
```yaml
# cat examples/orioledb/cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: orioledb-cluster
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterDefinition to use when creating a Cluster.
  clusterDef: orioledb
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterTopology to use when creating a Cluster.
  topology: orioledb
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Halt`: Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster. This field allows for detailed configuration of each component within the Cluster.
  # Note: `shardingSpecs` and `componentSpecs` cannot both be empty; at least one must be defined to configure a cluster.
  # ClusterComponentSpec defines the specifications for a Component in a Cluster.

      serviceType: LoadBalancer
    # Indicates whether the services will be exposed. 'Enable' exposes the services. while 'Disable' removes the exposed Service.
    switch: Enable
