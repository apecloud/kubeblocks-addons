description: Apache Doris is an MPP-based real-time data warehouse known for its high query speed. For queries on large datasets, it returns results in sub-seconds. It supports both high-concurrency point queries and high-throughput complex analysis. It can be used for report analysis, ad-hoc queries, unified data warehouse, and data lake query acceleration. Based on Apache Doris, users can build applications for user behavior analysis, A/B testing platform, log analysis, user profile analysis, and e-commerce order analysis.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 1.0.2

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
