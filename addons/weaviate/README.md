# Weaviate

Weaviate is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.

In Weaviate, metadata replication and data replication are separate. For the metadata, Weaviate uses the **Raft consensus** algorithm. For data replication, Weaviate uses a **leaderless** design with eventual consistency[^1].

## Examples

### Create

Create a weaviate cluster with three replicas:

```yaml
# cat examples/weaviate/cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: weaviate-cluster
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # Valid options are: [DoNotTerminate, Delete, WipeOut] (`Halt` is deprecated since KB 0.9)
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  componentSpecs:
    - name: weaviate
      componentDef: weaviate
      replicas: 3
      # Specifies the resources required by the Component.
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: "1Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      # Specifies a list of PersistentVolumeClaim templates that define the storage
      # requirements for the Component.
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        # Refers to the name of a volumeMount defined in
        # `componentDefinition.spec.runtime.containers[*].volumeMounts
        - name: data
          spec:
            # The name of the StorageClass required by the claim.
            # If not specified, the StorageClass annotated with
            # `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true` will be used by default
            storageClassName: ""
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                # Set the storage size as needed
                storage: 20Gi

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/cluster.yaml
```

### Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling up or down specified components requests and limits cpu or memory resource in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/weaviate/verticalscale.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: weaviate-verticalscaling
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: weaviate-cluster
  type: VerticalScaling
  # Lists VerticalScaling objects, each specifying a component and its desired compute resources for vertical scaling.
  verticalScaling:
  - componentName: weaviate
    # VerticalScaling refers to the process of adjusting the compute resources (e.g., CPU, memory) allocated to a Component. It defines the parameters required for the operation.
    requests:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: 1Gi

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/verticalscale.yaml
```

### Expand volume

Volume expansion is the ability to increase the size of a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) after it's created. It is introduced in Kubernetes v1.11 and goes GA in Kubernetes v1.24. It allows Kubernetes users to simply edit their PersistentVolumeClaim objects  without requiring any downtime at all if possible.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the storage class you use supports volume expansion.

Check the storage class with following command:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

If the `ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION` column is `true`, the storage class supports volume expansion.

To increase size of volume storage with the specified components in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/postgresql/volumeexpand.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: pg-volumeexpansion
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: pg-cluster
  type: VolumeExpansion
  # Lists VolumeExpansion objects, each specifying a component and its corresponding volumeClaimTemplates that requires storage expansion.
  volumeExpansion:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: postgresql
    # volumeClaimTemplates specifies the storage size and volumeClaimTemplate name.
    volumeClaimTemplates:
    - name: data
      storage: 30Gi

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/postgresql/volumeexpand.yaml
```

### Restart

Restart the specified components in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/weaviate/restart.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: weaviate-restart
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: weaviate-cluster
  type: Restart
  # Lists Components to be restarted. ComponentOps specifies the Component to be operated on.
  restart:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: weaviate

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/restart.yaml
```

### Stop

Stop the cluster and release all the pods of the cluster, but the storage will be reserved

```yaml
# cat examples/weaviate/stop.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: weaviate-stop
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: weaviate-cluster
  type: Stop

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/stop.yaml
```

### Start

Start the stopped cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/weaviate/start.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: weaviate-start
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: weaviate-cluster
  type: Start

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/start.yaml
```

### Configure

Configure parameters with the specified components in the cluster:

```yaml
# cat examples/weaviate/configure.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: weaviate-reconfiguring
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: weaviate-cluster
  # Instructs the system to bypass pre-checks (including cluster state checks and customized pre-conditions hooks) and immediately execute the opsRequest, except for the opsRequest of 'Start' type, which will still undergo pre-checks even if `force` is true.  Note: Once set, the `force` field is immutable and cannot be updated.
  force: false
  # Specifies a component and its configuration updates. This field is deprecated and replaced by `reconfigures`.
  reconfigures:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
    - componentName: weaviate
      # Contains a list of ConfigurationItem objects, specifying the Component's configuration template name, upgrade policy, and parameter key-value pairs to be updated.
      configurations:
        # Sets the parameters to be updated. It should contain at least one item.
        # The keys are merged and retained during patch operations.
        - keys:
            # Represents the unique identifier for the ConfigMap.
            - key: envs
              # Defines a list of key-value pairs for a single configuration file.
              # These parameters are used to update the specified configuration settings.
              parameters:
                # Represents the name of the parameter that is to be updated.
                - key: QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT
                  # Represents the parameter values that are to be updated.
                  # If set to nil, the parameter defined by the Key field will be removed from the configuration file.
                  value: "150"
          # Specifies the name of the configuration template.
          name: weaviate-env-template
  # Specifies the maximum number of seconds the OpsRequest will wait for its start conditions to be met before aborting. If set to 0 (default), the start conditions must be met immediately for the OpsRequest to proceed.
  preConditionDeadlineSeconds: 0
  type: Reconfiguring

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/weaviate/configure.yaml
```

It sets `QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT` to 150, and all pods will be restarted to apply the new configuration.

### Delete

If you want to delete the cluster and all its resource, you can modify the termination policy and then delete the cluster

```bash
kubectl patch cluster weaviate-cluster -p '{"spec":{"terminationPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"

kubectl delete cluster weaviate-cluster
```
