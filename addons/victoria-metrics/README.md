# VictoriaMetrics

VictoriaMetrics is a fast, scalable, and resource-efficient open-source time-series database (TSDB) and monitoring solution. It is designed to handle high volumes of time-series data with high performance and low resource usage. VictoriaMetrics is compatible with Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring tools.

VictoriaMetrics can run in two modes:

1. **Single-Node**: All-in-one deployment for smaller workloads.
2. **Cluster Mode**: Distributed architecture for large-scale deployments.

## Core Components (Cluster Mode)

1. **vmstorage**
  Stateful, stores time-series data. Handles data partitioning and replication.
2. **vminsert**
  Stateless, Accepts ingested data and routes it to the appropriate `vmstorage` node.
3. **vmselect**
  Stateless, Handles queries by aggregating results from `vmstorage` nodes.

## Examples

### Create

Create a VM cluster:

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: vmcluster
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusterDef: victoria-metrics
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  topology: vm-cluster
  componentSpecs:
    - name: vmstorage
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
              - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 20Gi
      env:
        - name: RETENTION_PERIOD
          value: "30d"
    - name: vmselect
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
    - name: vminsert
      # This configuration ensures that when updates are applied to the cluster,
      # only 2 replicas will be updated at a time.
      # This minimizes downtime and ensures that the application remains available during the update process.
      instanceUpdateStrategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 1
          replicas: 2
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
        requests:
          cpu: "0.5"
          memory: "0.5Gi"
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/cluster.yaml
```

#### Set Prometheus remote write to VM

When the cluster status is `Running`, you may set Prometheus `remote_write` to VM by setting:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
spec:
...
 remoteWrite:
  # http://<vminsert-addr>:8480/insert/{tenantID}/prometheus
  - url: http://vmcluster-vminsert.default.svc.cluster.local:8480/insert/0/prometheus
...
```

#### Add VM as a new DataSource in Grafana

Go to `Grafana-> Connections -> Add New Data Source -> Prometheus` and set connection URL to `http://vmcluster-vmselect.default.svc.cluster.local:8481/select/0/prometheus`,
where `0` is tenant ID.

### Horizontal scaling

#### Scale-out

Horizontal scaling out by adding ONE more replica:

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/scale-out.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: vm-scale-out
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: vm-cluster
  type: HorizontalScaling
  # Lists HorizontalScaling objects, each specifying scaling requirements for a Component, including desired total replica counts, configurations for new instances, modifications for existing instances, and instance downscaling options
  horizontalScaling:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
    # - vminsert
    # - vmselect
  - componentName: vmselect
    # Specifies the replica changes for scaling in components
    scaleOut:
      # Specifies the replica changes for the component.
      # add one more replica to current component
      replicaChanges: 1
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/scale-out.yaml
```

#### Scale-in

Horizontal scaling out by deleting ONE replica:

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/scale-in.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: vm-scale-in
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: vmcluster
  type: HorizontalScaling
  # Lists HorizontalScaling objects, each specifying scaling requirements for a Component, including desired total replica counts, configurations for new instances, modifications for existing instances, and instance downscaling options
  horizontalScaling:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
    # - vmselect
    # - vminsert
  - componentName: vmselect
    # Specifies the replica changes for scaling in components
    scaleIn:
      # Specifies the replica changes for the component.
      # add one more replica to current component
      replicaChanges: 1
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/scale-in.yaml
```

#### Scale-in/out using Cluster API

Alternatively, you can update the `replicas` field in the `spec.componentSpecs.replicas` section to your desired non-zero number.

```yaml
# snippet of cluster.yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeblocks.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  componentSpecs:
    - name: vmselect
      replicas: 3 # Set the number of replicas to your desired number
```

#### Caution: Scale-in/out VMStorage

**Scaling Out** vmstorage

1. Scale-Out `vmstorage` by adding one more instance.
1. Restart `vmselect` component.
1. Restart `vminsert` component.

- Restart ONE or TWO replica first, and observe the time-series count metrics of the entire cluster.
- Wait for the cluster to stabilize, then upgrade and restart the remaining `vminsert` replicas.

**Scaling In** vmstorage
The scaling-down process is the reverse of scaling up. First, restart `vminsert`, then restart `vmselect`. If the new `vmstorage` instance is only in `vminsert` and not in `vmselect`, data written to the new `vmstorage` instance will be unqueryable until the new instance is added to `vmselect`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Why Gradual Restart is Necessary for `vminsert` Upgrades

When the `storageNode` list changes, some timeseries may be relocated. For example, a timeseries previously stored on `Node A` might be stored on `Node B` after the restart. If a large number of new timeseries suddenly appear on `Node B`, it can severely impact performance. Additionally, if the `-storage.maxHourlySeries` or `-storage.maxDailySeries` limits are reached, `BNode` may reject the newly migrated timeseries.

Therefore, we only upgrade one or two `vminsert` instances initially. This allows a small number of requests to shift, enabling the migrated timeseries to create indexes on the new Storage Node (index creation is resource-intensive). After this, we upgrade the remaining `vminsert` instances.

To achieve controlled `Gradual Restart` of vminsert, we use `instanceUpdateStrategy` API in KubeBlocks:

```yaml
    - name: vminsert
      # This configuration ensures that when updates are applied to the cluster,
      # only 1 replicas will be updated at a time.
      instanceUpdateStrategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 1
          replicas: 1
```

When the cluster goes stable, patch the cluster with set `replicas: 2` to update one more replicas, and set `replicas: <total_replicas>` to update all remaining replicas.

### Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling up or down specified components requests and limits cpu or memory resource in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/verticalscale.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: vm-vscale
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: vmcluster
  type: VerticalScaling
  # Lists VerticalScaling objects, each specifying a component and its desired compute resources for vertical scaling.
  verticalScaling:
  - componentName: vmselect
    # VerticalScaling refers to the process of adjusting the compute resources (e.g., CPU, memory) allocated to a Component. It defines the parameters required for the operation.
    requests:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: '1'
      memory: 1Gi

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/verticalscale.yaml
```

### Expand volume

Increase size of volume storage with the specified components in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/volumeexpand.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: vm-volumeexpansion
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: vmcluster
  type: VolumeExpansion
  # Lists VolumeExpansion objects, each specifying a component and its corresponding volumeClaimTemplates that requires storage expansion.
  volumeExpansion:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
  - componentName: vmstorage
    # volumeClaimTemplates specifies the storage size and volumeClaimTemplate name.
    volumeClaimTemplates:
    - name: data
      storage: 30Gi

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/volumeexpand.yaml
```

### Restart

Restart the specified components in the cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/restart.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: vm-restart-vminsert
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: vmcluster
  type: Restart
  # Lists Components to be restarted. ComponentOps specifies the Component to be operated on.
  restart:
    # Specifies the name of the Component.
    # - vmstorage
    # - vminsert
    # - vmselect
    - componentName: vmstorage

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/restart.yaml
```

### Stop

Stop the cluster and release all the pods of the cluster, but the storage will be reserved

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/stop.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: vm-stop
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: vmcluster
  type: Stop

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/stop.yaml
```

### Start

Start the stopped cluster

```yaml
# cat examples/victoria-metrics/start.yaml
apiVersion: operations.kubeblocks.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpsRequest
metadata:
  name: vm-start
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Specifies the name of the Cluster resource that this operation is targeting.
  clusterName: vmcluster
  type: Start

```

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/victoria-metrics/start.yaml
```

### Delete

If you want to delete the cluster and all its resource, you can modify the termination policy and then delete the cluster

```bash
kubectl patch cluster vmcluster -p '{"spec":{"terminationPolicy":"WipeOut"}}' --type="merge"

kubectl delete cluster vmcluster
```
