 # the spec_helper can be used to set shell options for all specfiles, define global functions,check the execution shell, load custom matchers, etc.
# It is loaded from SHELLSPEC_LOAD_PATH using the --require option.
--require spec_helper

# by default, all the specfiles named with "*_spec.sh" in the "**/scripts-ut-spec" directory will be executed
--default-path "**/scripts-ut-spec"

# by default, the execution directory for testing is where the specfile is located
--execdir @specfile

# by default, use the bash shell. if not set, run source may use a shell different from the one used to run the specfile (it seems to be a bug)
--shell bash

# By default only shell scripts whose names contain .sh are coverage targeted. If you want to include other files, you need to adjust options with --kcov-options.
# --kcov-options "--include-path=. --path-strip-level=1"
--kcov-options "--include-pattern=.sh"
--kcov-options "--exclude-pattern=/.shellspec,/spec/,/coverage/,/report/"

## Example: Include script "myprog" with no extension
# --kcov-options "--include-pattern=.sh,myprog"

## Example: Only specified files/directories
# --kcov-options "--include-pattern=myprog,/lib/"
