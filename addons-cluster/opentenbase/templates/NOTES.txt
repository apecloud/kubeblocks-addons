Thanks for installing OpenTenBase using KubeBlocks!

1. Run the following command to create your first OpenTenBase cluster:

```
helm install otb ./opentenbase-cluster
```

2. Port-forward service to localhost and connect to OpenTenBase cluster:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/otb-cn-0 5432:5432
psql -h127.0.0.1 -U opentenbase postgres
```
